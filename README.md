# Tailwind CSS Configuration Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered while configuring Tailwind CSS.
The error manifests as unexpected behavior or errors when using Tailwind directives, classes, or configurations.
This could range from styles not applying correctly, unexpected layout issues, or runtime errors.

## Description
